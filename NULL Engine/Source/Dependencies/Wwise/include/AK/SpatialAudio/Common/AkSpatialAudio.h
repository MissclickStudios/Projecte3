		/// Add or update an individual image source for processing via the AkReflect plug-in.  Use this API for detailed placement of

		/// The SpatialAudio API manages image sources added via SetImageSource() and sends them to the AkReflect plug-in that is on the aux bus with ID \c in_AuxBusID. 
		/// The image source will apply only to the the game object specified by \c in_gameObjectID.
		/// SetImageSource takes a room ID to indicate which room the reflection is logically part of, even though the position of the image source may be outside of the extents of the room.  
		/// This ID is used as a filter, so that it is not possible to hear reflections for rooms that the emitter and listener are not both inside.  To use this feature, the emitter's and listener's rooms must also be
