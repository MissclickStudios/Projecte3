					"Text": "Greetings Bounty Hunter. If you are listening to this message I can understand two things. One, that Greef Karga thinks you are the best in the parsec and two, that you are expensive. Very expensive. Indeed, that is not a problem we may have to involve ourselves in. I guess you have no clue or information about what you are looking for. Unfortunately, neither do I, at least from the point of view of localization. Let me tell you all you need to know. I’m afraid this job dictates a less traditional agreement. About the chain code, we can only provide you 4 digits, Its age. You are looking for a 50 years old creature, Its last localization was in Arvala-7, a couple of days ago. With that little information, a man of your skill should make a profitable work out of this. About the bounty, I need It alive. Although, I acknowledge that bounty hunting is a complicated profession. This being the case, proof of termination is also acceptable for a lower fee. It is good to restore the natural order of things after a period of such disarray, don't you agree? That is all. Contact Greef when you finish the job, I have a tones of Beskar waiting for you upon the delivery of the asset. End of transmission "
