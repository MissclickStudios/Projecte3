				},
				{
					"Speaker": "Greef Karga",

					"Speaker": "Mando",
					"Text": "The empire is gone, I do not know if you heard about It. The value of these credits is decreasing rapidly."

				},
				{
					"Speaker": "Greef Karga",
					"Text": "Very expensive. Indeed, that is not a problem we may have to involve ourselves in. I guess you have no clue or information about what you are looking for."
				},
				{
					"Speaker": "Greef Karga",
					"Text": "Unfortunately, neither do I, at least from the point of view of localization."
				},
				{
					"Speaker": "Greef Karga",
					"Text": "Let me tell you all you need to know. I am afraid this job is a less traditional agreement."
				},
				{
					"Speaker": "Greef Karga",
					"Text": "About the chain code, we can only provide you 4 digits, Its age."
				},
				{
					"Speaker": "Greef Karga",
					"Text": "You are looking for a 50 years old creature, Its last localization was in Arvala-7, a couple of days ago."
				},
				{
					"Speaker": "Greef Karga",
					"Text": "With that little information, a man of your skill should make a profitable work out of this."
				},
				{
					"Speaker": "Greef Karga",
					"Text": "About the bounty, I need It alive. Although, I acknowledge that bounty hunting is a complicated profession."
				},
				{
					"Speaker": "Greef Karga",
					"Text": "This being the case, proof of termination is also acceptable for a lower fee."
				},
				{
					"Speaker": "Greef Karga",
					"Text": "It is good to restore the natural order of things after a period of such disarray. That is all."
				},
				{

					"Text": "Contact me when you finish the job, I have a tones of Beskar waiting for you upon the delivery of the asset. *End of transmission*"
