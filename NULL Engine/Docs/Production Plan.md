# Production Plan

For the production of this game, a 18 weeks plan divided in different stages and milestones, that will be completed using many techniques such as Sprints and a Gantt Chart, has been scheduled.

## Methodology
### Scrum

We will develop this project using the Scrum methodology which is more focused on short & structured sprints. The initial work will be done by departments and once the projects starts getting on track we will split in scrum teams for each of those sprints.

## Team Structure

The team is formed by 25 people who will have different responsabilities in the production of the game. It will consist of 1 Producer, 8 Designers, 7 Artists, and 9 programmers.

### Producer

The figure of the Producer will be the one in charge of the management of the project. Their responsibility is to keep track that the project goes toward the intentioned direction, achieving the different goals for each milestone and helping with the communication of the different elements of the team.

### Departments

The team will be distributed in three different departments: Code, Design and Art. Each department will have a Lead in charge of the distribution and management of tasks as well as aiding their teams with any complications they might find. The communication of the different departments will go through the producer

## General Calendar
### Gantt Chart
In order to have a better perspective of the development plan, a Gantt chart was created. This chart allows to represent both all the milestones and the available development time. 

In the chart shown below all the project's milestones as well as their development in time can be observed:

### Sprints (Scrum)

- **Weekly goals:** Set to make sure that the development phase is progressing according to plan, their main objective is to have a meaningful QA session.

- **Producer & Leads meetings:** Will take place at least once a week or whenever it is needed. Their purpose will be to facilitate the communication among departments and to speed up decision-making processes. This meetings will be called by the producer and although it would be ideal for all the leads to attend, some of them might not be required depending on the topic of discussion.

- **Weekly meetings:** Will take place every Tuesday by 8:30 AM and Thrusday by 10:30 AM and as long as needed, they will be online meetings, due to covid-19, using the platform Discord. This meetings will start with general information that might concern everyone, after that everyone will split into scrum teams and the producer and investors will go through every group and discuss the work done. The main purpose of these meeting will be to answer any questions the members of the team might have, to express and analyze any issues encountered in the departments, and to make sure everyone is working towards the same goal and objectives. Everyone on the team is required in this meetings and the lack of assistance will severly affect their evaluation.

- **During the week:** Constant communication will be maintained through the team's *discord* server, where every member has been tagged according to their role or department, to coordinate properly any task related issue. Additionally, a *HacknPlan* project will keep being updated in order to keep track of the state of each tasks.

### Production control

In order to track the consistency of the different members of the departments, which will be key to ensure the completion of the goals for each milestone, we will keep a google sheet document where everyone will update the hours they have worked on a task for the project each day. We will also use that information so the different leads of the departments are able to evaluate the performance of their team.

### Milestones
Apart from the weekly objectives, there will be 8 milestones that since they are only separated by two weeks, will define the duration of each sprint.


### Keeping track of the milestones
As there is a daunting amount of milestones to reach, the Producer and the Leads are the ones in charged to keep track of the HacknPlan project so no task is left behind. After each milestone, the production plan will be reviewed.



## Risk Contingency List
Different situations that might occur during the production phase of the project have been listed and ranked according to the probability of ocurrence, their impact on the project. Moreover, a fesible contingency plan has been developed for each of the events.

| **RISK**        | **PROBABILITY** | **IMPACT** | **SOLUTION** |
| --------------- |:---------------:| :----------:| ------------ |
| A team member is unable to continue working on the project | Really Low | Really High | The tasks assigned to the missing member will be divided and reasigned to the rest of the team. Should it not be possible, whether it is feasible to abandon and eliminate the tasks  without heavily affecting the final product or not will be studied. |
| A team member has fallen sick | High  | Low/Medium | Depending on the severity of the illness, the weekly objectives assigned to the affected team member will be transferred to other members. Should the aforementioned be able to work, albeit at a slower pace, management will call in an ahead-of-schedule team member in assistance.|
| Weekly objectives have not been met   | Medium | Medium | During the scheduled weekly meeting, the unachieved milestones will be redistributed and an evaluation on why the team was unable to accomplish them will be made. Should any team member know that their objectives will not be met under any circumstances, management should be notified as soon as possible so a contingency plan can be prepared. |
| Major milestones not achieved in time   | Low | High | An evaluation on what caused the issue will start so the team avoids facing the same issues at a later date. Following that, all missing tasks will be rescheduled (in case they cannot be excluded from the final product without major issues) and management will decide whether to eliminate some of the items scheduled for the next major milestone or not. |
| A core mechanic is not working properly   | Medium | High | QA will get in touch with the Code Lead in order to fix the issue as soon as possible. |
| A design element is not well-suited for the desired goal   | Medium | Medium | QA will get in touch with the Design Lead in order to fix the issue as soon as possible. |
| Art/Audio being incorrectly implemented | Low | Medium/High | QA will get in touch with the Art&Audio Lead in order to fix the issue as soon as possible. |
| A team member's equipment breaks down | Very Low | Very High | The Producer will evaluate any alternate option since borrowing material or working at TTC is no longer a feasible option until the covid situation improves  |
| The producer isn't attending the needs of the project | Very Low | Very High | If the Leads or Teachers consider that the Producer is not up to the tasks, they should call a meeting with him to discuss it, in case he cannot meet the terms established, a new Producer should be appointed |
| The Lead of a department isn't attending its responsabilities | Very Low | Very High | If the Producer or other Leads consider that said Lead is not up to the tasks, they should call a meeting with him to discuss it, in case he cannot meet the terms established, a new Lead should be appointed |


If there was any doubts with the resolution of a risky situation, the protocol would be to attend the producer who will decide which solution is more appropiate, he will decide who might want to involve in that decision (teachers, leads, etc)
