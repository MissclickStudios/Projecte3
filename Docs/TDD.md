|     Hardware    |         Requirements        |  Minimum Requirements  |
| --------------- | --------------------------- | ---------------------- |
|       OS        | Windows 10 *version*        | Windows 7 Professional |
|       CPU       | Intel Core i7-9750H 2.6Hz   | Intel Core i3          |
|       GPU       | NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060 6GB | Integrated             |
|       RAM       | 16GB                        | 100 MB                 |
| Free Disk Space | ???                         | 200 MB                 |

- Must correctly run in the university computers.

### Performance Budget
The final build must run at 60fps in the target platform described above.
The base screen resolution will be 1280x720px. Moreover Fullscreen mode, as well as Windowed mode, must be supported.

### External Libraries
All the external libraries that will be employed during the project's development will be shown down below:



## Branching Policy
- Branches shall be used to maintain a healthy paralel development. Merges will be made on the weekly meetings when close to a delivery or when a feature is properly or fully implemented.

## Data Layout
There are two main folders holding files for our project:

### 2. Docs

Holds all files used for the Github wiki. This includes .md files for text and images used in the wiki.

There are various folders used for images to have them better organized.

## Build Delivery Method
- Release through Github


## Version List
- {List containing all the current and previous versions and should detail what was implemented in each one of them}
